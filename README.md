# Scala SBT Project Template

This is a [Giter8](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/) template that will create an empty Scala SBT project 
using the typical JVM/SBT layout.

It includes ScalaTest and Typesafe Config & Scala Logging (with Logback).

## Usage

    $ sbt new jbratton/scala-sbt.g8

Then enter a few properties and the empty project structure will be created.
